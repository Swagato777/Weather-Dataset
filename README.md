# Weather Dataset Analysis with Pandas
This project explores a weather dataset using the pandas library in Python. The dataset contains historical weather information recorded over a period of time.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named weather_data.csv. It includes the following columns:

# Date:
The date of the weather record.
# Temperature: 
The temperature recorded on the corresponding date (in Celsius).
# Humidity: 
The humidity level recorded on the corresponding date.
# Precipitation: 
The precipitation amount recorded on the corresponding date (in millimeters).
# Wind_Speed: 
The wind speed recorded on the corresponding date (in kilometers per hour).
# Analysis:
The analysis performed on the dataset includes the following:

# Data Loading:
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the read_csv() function.
# Data Exploration: 
Various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
#Summary Statistics: 
Summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation are computed for numerical columns.
# Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
# Feature Engineering: Additional features are created from existing columns to extract meaningful information.
# Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests and analyses may be performed to derive insights and conclusions from the data.
